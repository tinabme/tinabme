**Ingredients + Measurements:**

Egg Noodles
- 1 c all purpose flour
- 1 egg
- pinch of salt


Soup
- 1 whole chicken (3 to 5 lbs)
- 32 oz chicken broth
- 1 tbs oil (olive oil)
- 1/2 onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 2 carrots, chopped (or equivalent baby carrots)
- 1 tbs parsley flakes
- 1 t dried mustard
- fresh ground Pepper, to taste
- salt, to taste


**Directions:** 
	
- Chicken should be fresh or completely thawed, with the giblets removed </br>(1 neck,1 gizzard,1 heart,2 kidneys, 1 liver) Not all chickens are sold with all the giblets.

- In a large pot add oil, onion, garlic sauté for about 1 minute until it gets aromatic

- Add 1/2 of the celery and 1/2 of the carrots

- Then place chicken in the pot breast side up, add water until the chicken is 1/2 submerged and then add enough of the chicken broth to just cover the chicken. Stir to mix the veggies and broth evenly.

- Simmer (not boil) for 1 to 1 1/2 hours

- While the chicken is cooking, start on the egg noodles.

  - In a medium bowl mix flour, egg, and pinch of salt.

  - Roll out on floured surface (~1/16 in or 2 mm thick) 

  - Cut into strips between 1/4 to 1/2 in wide and 1 to 2 in long _(doesn't need to be perfect, and they will expand slightly)_ leaving then in-place to dry out a bit

- After the chicken has simmered for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, using tongs flip the chicken over to breast side down. Careful not to splash and try to keep the chicken whole _(no worries if it breaks, you'll just need to find all the bones later)_

- Add the remaining celery and carrots as well as the parsley flakes, dried mustard, and some salt and pepper. Simmer for another 1 to 1 1/2 hours until the chicken is fully cooked and easy to pull off the bone.

- Using the tongs and a sturdy plate, remove chicken from the pot and let it cool enough so that you can pull the meat off the bone. Make sure to feel around in the pane to get any pieces that may have broken off.

- While the Chicken is cooling, add the noodles to the soup, one at a time so they don’t clump together, and stir.

- Pull the meat off the bone, break into chunks, and put it back in the soup and turn off the heat to let it cool and thicken about 30 minutes before serving. _(be sure to exclude all bone, skin, and yucky veins from the soup, just yummy chicken meat)_
