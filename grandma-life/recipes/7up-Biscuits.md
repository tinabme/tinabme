-	2 1/2 cups baking mix ~(or Bisquick)~
-	1/2 cup 7up or sprite ~(or lemon lime soda)~
-	1/2 cup sour cream
-	1/4 cup butter melted

**Directions:**
-	Heat oven to 450 degrees
-	In a medium bowl stir together 2 cups of baking mix, soda, and sour cream.
-	Sprinkle the counter with the remaining baking mix and dump the dough out on it.
-	Get some of the baking mix (flour) on your hands and pat the dough out to about 1/2 inch thick. Then fold the dough into quarters and pat down again to about 1/2 inch thick.
-	Pour the melted butter into a pie pan (or 8 x 8 baking dish).
-	Cut the biscuits out and place in the pan of butter.
-	Bake for 13 to 16 minutes until cooked through.

- When placing the biscuits in the pan, sides touching is better.
- If the top starts to get too dark, you can lay a piece of foil on top of the partially cooked biscuits to finish cooking.
